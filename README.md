# A Restaurant Website
A 2-month project which incorporates the software development life cycle, working with a team to design, create, and test a restaurant website based on the requirements given by stakeholders. Tasks included but was not limited to: creating sketches, code, test cases and Jira.

## Motivation
To apply all that we have learned, in order to create a fully functional website that fulfills the stakeholders requirements. 

## Synopsis:
### **Software Requirements Specification Document:**
Carefully listening to the stakeholders and asking questions in order to create a SRS document that complies with client's needs. 

### **Sketch:**
Created a sketch for the overall layout of the website. Used the wireframe tool: *XMind*, to show a fresher look of restaurant website. 

### **Coded Website:**
Used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript to build website

### **Testing:**
Created Test Cases on JIRA for major and minor functionalties of the restuarant website. These test cases were tested by fellow peers for accuracy and completeness. 


### **Testing Peers' Websites:**
First, used their test cases to replicate the steps in achieving the expected results. If the actual and expected results did not match, a defect report was submitted. Next, performed exploratory testing taking notes on any bugs or issues encountered. 

### **Fixing Website:**
Fixed all bugs that were reported by peers.


### **Retesting:**
The restaurant website was retested to verify that the defects have been fixed and no new defects have been introduced. 

### **Instructor Lead Testing:**
The instructor of the course demonstrated a live testing session for each of our groups' website.
